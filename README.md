A website providing a dictionary and interface for writing in [neoideograms](http://neoideograms.wordpress.com)!

The code for the site itself is released under the MIT license (though the libraries in web/lib/ have their own licenses). The data, under web/data and in the Firebase backend, is released under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

### TODOs
* Upload the offline data-processing code
* Refactor the JS to use a single coherent data-access scheme
* Use individual SVGs or a custom font for ideogram images
* Much more!
